# Edgy

**[Try the app!](https://snapapps.github.io/edgy/app/edgy.html)**

Edgy is a block-based programming language and an algorithm design environment that runs in a web browser. It provides a hands on interface to manipulate graphs via algorithms.

## Dependencies
Edgy is powered by both [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu/) (from UC Berkeley)  which allows you to snap blocks together to build programs, and [JSNetworkX](http://felix-kling.de/JSNetworkX/) to both visualise and provide functionality to work with graphs.

Currently Edgy has two force-directed layout algorithms. By default Edgy uses the [WebCoLa](http://marvl.infotech.monash.edu/webcola/examples/unconstrainedsmallworld.html) algorithm to arrange graphs, but you can switch to the original [D3.js](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045) algorithm if it suits you better.

## Example
Here is an example of minimal spanning tree, adapted from Tim Bell's CS Unplugged [Muddy City](http://csunplugged.org/sites/default/files/activity_pdfs_old/unplugged-09-minimal_spanning_trees-original.pdf) activity.

## Development

Edgy has been developed by [Steven Bird](http://estive.net/) and students (Mak Nazečić-Andrlon, Jarred Gallina) at the University of Melbourne.
